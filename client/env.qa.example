# Sample QA environment for Vite client
# Copy to .env.qa and adjust before build/deploy

# Base URL of API Gateway (WITHOUT trailing slash)
# If your API uses stages (e.g., qa), append the stage segment at the end.
# Example (with stage):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/qa
# Example (no stage):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com

VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/qa
